Please refer to the **README_APP_and_QFMatch.py** Python script or **README_APP_and_QFMatch.sh** shell script.

Attempt to execute either of them to replicate the results.

Before running scripts please make sure to install Python dependencies using the **deps_python.sh** shell script for macOS or the **deps_python.cmd** script for Windows. You also may be need to install the Visual Studio Command Line Tools and the Windows SDK before installing dependencies for Windows.

### The scripts were tested with the following Python versions:

For Windows - Python 3.7.9

For macOS - Python 3.8 via homebrew:

````brew install python@3.8````

## The Folder Descriptions:

**APP** - the group of scripts that applies APP itself on the unclustered data.

**QFMatch_asymmetric** - the group of scripts that executes many clusters-to-one cluster (asymmetric) matching with QFMatch between the test set and training set results of the distance metric learning script, and further  visualizes the matching outcomes and computes the misclassification
rate (if this task is required).

**QFMatch_symmetric** - the group of scripts that executes many clusters-to-many cluster (symmetric) matching with QFMatch between the test set and training set results of the distance metric learning script, and further  visualizes the matching outcomes and computes the misclassification
rate (if this task is required).

**QFMatch_custom** - the script that executes many clusters-to-many cluster matching with QFMatch between
the test set and training set results of the distance metric learning script, and could be applied for the test set and the train set with different numbers of cells between them.

**QFMatch_label_transfer** - the script that assigns labels to the raw test data based on the clustered train data, and also the script that filters noise (if any), then executes many clusters-to-one cluster (asymmetric) matching with QFMatch between the test set and training set results of the distance metric learning script, and further  visualizes the matching outcomes and computes the misclassification
rate (if this task is required).

## Output Folder Descriptions:

**results:** This folder contains the resulting CSV files and run statistics TXT files generated by the APP.

**all_proj:** If the draw_all flag within the script is set to True, this folder will contain all the projections PNG files found by the APP. Otherwise, it will be empty.

**all_split:** Similar to "all_proj," this folder holds all the split PNG files found by the APP if the draw_all flag is set to True; otherwise, it remains empty.

**split:** This folder contains the split images used by the APP to create the resulting clusters.

**dml:** The resulting CSV files from the dml process are stored in this folder.

**png:** The PNG files resulting from the QFMatch process are stored in this folder.

**misclassification:** The QFMatch misclassification rate TXT files are located in this folder.

**match_result:** The CSV files containing the QFMatch match results are stored in this folder.

**run_stats:** The run statistics TXT files from the APP are found in this folder.

**QFMatch:** The QFMatch_label_transfer results with assigned labels are located in this folder.
